[{"id":0,"href":"/guide/introduction/","title":"Introduction","parent":"Guide","content":"ProBIND3 is a web application designed for managing the DNS zones for one or more servers running the ISC BIND DNS server software. It works best for companies that need to manage a medium-sized pool of domains across a set of servers.\nThe application has been written using Laravel framework. It stores its data in a database (see Laravel Database Backend) and generates configuration files for BIND on-demand.\nWhat ProBIND3 Is ProBIND3 is meant to be a time-saving tool for busy administrators, aiding in managing the configuration of DNS zones across multiple servers. It is intended for use by those already familiar with the components of a DNS zone file and who understand DNS concepts and methods.\nThis software acts as a configuration repository to help keep zones well-maintained and has several helping tools to ensure that common DNS issues are minimized.\nWhat ProBIND3 Is Not Although ProBIND3 uses a database to store zone data, it is not a replacement backend for ISC BIND. ProBIND3 merely creates the proper zone files for use with the default configuration method of BIND. If you are looking for a live SQL backend for ISC BIND, this is not one.\nProBIND3 is not a tool for those unfamiliar with DNS concepts. It assumes you know the differences between a CNAME and an A record. It also assumes you know about SOA records, what a lame server is, and what glue is.\nProBIND3 is not the ultimate solution to DNS management. It fits the needs of those who develop it, and it is hoped that others will also find it useful.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/guide/getting-started/","title":"Getting started","parent":"Guide","content":"This page tells you how to get started with the ProBIND3 app, including installation and basic configuration.\nHow to run ProBIND3 How to run ProBIND3 Laravel Sail is a light-weight command-line interface for interacting with Laravel\u0026rsquo;s default Docker development environment. This will create several containers to implement the application needs. An Application server, a Database server and a Sample server (with SSH access).\nPrior to this installation, you need to have installed this software:\nDocker Clone the repository locally\ngit clone https://github.com/pacoorozco/probind.git probind cd probind Copy .env.example to .env.\nNOTE: You don\u0026rsquo;t need to touch anything from this file. It works with default settings.\nInstall PHP dependencies with:\nNOTE: You don\u0026rsquo;t need to install neither PHP nor Composer, we are going to use a Composer image instead.\ndocker run --rm \\ --user \u0026#34;$(id -u):$(id -g)\u0026#34; \\ --volume $(pwd):/var/www/html \\ --workdir /var/www/html \\ laravelsail/php81-composer:latest \\ composer install --ignore-platform-reqs Start all containers with the sail command.\n./vendor/bin/sail up -d Seed database in order to play with some data\nsail artisan key:generate sail artisan migrate:fresh --seed Point your browser to http://localhost. Enjoy!\nNOTE: Default credentials are admin/secret.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/","title":"ProBIND3","parent":"","content":" ProBIND3 is a web application designed for managing the DNS zones for servers running the ISC BIND DNS software.\nIt works best for companies that need to manage a medium-sized pool of domains across a set of servers.\nGetting Started Video overview "},{"id":3,"href":"/guide/","title":"Guide","parent":"ProBIND3","content":""},{"id":4,"href":"/categories/","title":"Categories","parent":"ProBIND3","content":""},{"id":5,"href":"/tags/","title":"Tags","parent":"ProBIND3","content":""}]
