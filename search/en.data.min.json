[{"id":0,"href":"/guide/introduction/","title":"Introduction","parent":"Guide","content":"ProBIND3 is a web application designed for managing the DNS zones for one or more servers running the ISC BIND DNS server software. It works best for companies that need to manage a medium-sized pool of domains across a set of servers.\nThe application has been written using Laravel framework. It stores its data in a database (see Laravel Database Backend) and generates configuration files for BIND on-demand.\nWhat ProBIND3 Is ProBIND3 is meant to be a time-saving tool for busy administrators, aiding in managing the configuration of DNS zones across multiple servers. It is intended for use by those already familiar with the components of a DNS zone file and who understand DNS concepts and methods.\nThis software acts as a configuration repository to help keep zones well-maintained and has several helping tools to ensure that common DNS issues are minimized.\nWhat ProBIND3 Is Not Although ProBIND3 uses a database to store zone data, it is not a replacement backend for ISC BIND. ProBIND3 merely creates the proper zone files for use with the default configuration method of BIND. If you are looking for a live SQL backend for ISC BIND, this is not one.\nProBIND3 is not a tool for those unfamiliar with DNS concepts. It assumes you know the differences between a CNAME and an A record. It also assumes you know about SOA records, what a lame server is, and what glue is.\nProBIND3 is not the ultimate solution to DNS management. It fits the needs of those who develop it, and it is hoped that others will also find it useful.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/guide/getting-started/","title":"Getting started","parent":"Guide","content":"This page tells you how to get started with the ProBIND3 app, including installation and basic configuration.\nHow to test ProBIND3 How to test ProBIND3 This will create several Docker containers to implement all ProBIND3 needs. An application server, a web server, a database server.\nClone the repository locally\ngit clone https://github.com/pacoorozco/probind.git probind cd probind Copy the .env.example file to .env.\nNOTE: You don\u0026rsquo;t need to touch anything from this file. It works with default settings.\ncp .env.example .env Start all containers with Docker Compose\nNOTE: You must export the DOCKER_PROBIND_UID variable if your user ID is different from 1000. This will allow the docker to get permissions over your files.\nexport DOCKER_PROBIND_UID=\u0026#34;$(id -u)\u0026#34; docker-compose build docker-compose up -d Install dependencies with:\ndocker-compose exec app composer install Seed database in order to play with some data\nNOTE: Remove --seed if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to seed sample data.\ndocker-compose exec app php artisan key:generate docker-compose exec app php artisan migrate:fresh --seed Go to http://localhost/install and finish ProBIND3 installation. Enjoy!\nNOTE: Default credentials are admin/secret.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/","title":"ProBIND3","parent":"","content":" ProBIND3 is a web application designed for managing the DNS zones for servers running the ISC BIND DNS software.\nIt works best for companies that need to manage a medium-sized pool of domains across a set of servers.\nGetting Started Video overview "},{"id":3,"href":"/guide/","title":"Guide","parent":"ProBIND3","content":""},{"id":4,"href":"/categories/","title":"Categories","parent":"ProBIND3","content":""},{"id":5,"href":"/tags/","title":"Tags","parent":"ProBIND3","content":""}]
