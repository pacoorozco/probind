ProBIND was originally developed by Flemming S. Johansen as part of his
duties as resident DNS manager at Proventum Solutions.  Later, a fork of
ProBIND called ProBIND2 was developed by Alexei P. Roudnev, a senior
network/software engineer, at Exigen Group LTD.

With both projects lying dormant for a number of years, Michael Johnson,
Systems Administrator at PhD Computing, attempted to revive the ProBIND
project. The enhancements made in ProBIND2 were merged in and development
were once again resumed.

Later, in 2016, Paco Orozco recoded all this code using Laravel Framework
to bring a new version of this application. It was named ProBIND3.

Here is an inevitably incomplete list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS --
people who have submitted patches, reported bugs, added translations, helped
answer newbie questions, and generally made ProBIND that much better:

    Paco Orozco <paco@pacoorozco.info>
